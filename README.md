# karmabum
Watch several RSS feeds and post any new articles to Hacker News

I wrote this script in 2015 to inflate my karma on HN. At the end of the day my IP and account were banned for botting, but I managed to quadruple my karma within 24 hours (close to the 500 karma threshold) so I call the experiment a win. Huge thanks to Dang for graciously unbanning my account. I promise to never bot my HN account again.

This script itself is complete, but out of courtesy to HN, I am leaving out the JavaScript portion (a custom userscript to automatically submit the pre-populated HN form). 

Provided RSS feeds are scraped every 30 seconds, and new articles are posted to HN via your web browser. If left running for any extended period, this script WILL get you banned. It is provided for educational purposes only.
